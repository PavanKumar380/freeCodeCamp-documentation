                <h2>An inspiration to us all:</h2>
                <p>
                    Despite his terminal cancer diagnosis, Chadwick chose to keep his illness private, giving the world one final performance as T'Chala in Avengers: Endgame.</p>
                <p>Till his final moments, he did not allow his illness to define him or hold him back.</p>
                <p>
                    Boseman himself was inspired to reprise his role as T'Chala despite his illness, when he visited a hospital and learned that two children were looking forward to T'Chala's return to the big screen.
